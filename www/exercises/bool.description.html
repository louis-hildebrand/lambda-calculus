<p>
	In the lambda calculus, booleans (i.e., "true" or "false") are represented as functions.
	Conventionally, "true" is the function <code>\t.\f.t</code>, while "false" is the function <code>\t.\f.f</code>.

<p>
	Try evaluating the functions for "true" and "false" and interpreting the results as booleans.
