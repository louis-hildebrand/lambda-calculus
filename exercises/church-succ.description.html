<p>
	Before implementing well-known arithmetic operations like addition, we should start with an even simpler function: the successor function, which simply increments a number.
	That is,
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>succ 0 = 1</code></li>
	<li><code>succ 1 = 2</code></li>
	<li><code>succ 2 = 3</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Implement the successor function.</p>
